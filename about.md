My name is Jordi Fernandez Oromi and I am mechanical engineer. I am also entrepreneur, software developer, runner, Buddhist, part-time vegan, husband, and a person who stammer, amongst many other things.

I do not believe on titles, tags, or traditions which classify people, although I understand that we need some sort of introduction of our current knowledge to others.

I believe that in the big scheme of things, there is nothing good or bad: being a person who stammer have closed and opened many doors (i.e. [Respira](www.respira.io)).

I believe that the all beings and the universe are connected in ways that we still cannot understand. I search for the universal principles (or truths) which governs nature and are unchangeable over time. I use those to give meaning and direction to my life. I find those principles reflecting in my own experience and science discoveries, but I also believe that those can be found in the (hidden) messages of the main stream religions (which says the same things with different words).

I created this blog for shellfish reasons (:)) to achieve he following:

1.  To learn more about how animals, individuals and the society act and think, which makes me to understand myself and others better.
2.  To reflect in my experiences and improve (0.1%) myself every day (i.e. compound wisdom of universal principles)
3.  To share thought and learnings with the hope to inspire others.
4.  To share the above insights with my family in a timeline of events.

Best wishes to all.
