Around 50% of the people get divorced in the UK. Still, many people think that those stats do not apply to them. Perhaps if we would worry a bit that divorce may happen to us, then we may put all the measures in place to avoid this.

Although I wholeheartedly agree with the following quote, I would like to dig deeper into the question: why those worries never happened? 

> I've had a lot of worries in my life, most of which never happened.
> <footer><strong>Mark Twain</strong> &mdash;</footer>

In my experience, the worries that I worried about never happened, but the stuff that I did not expect gave me trouble. In my opinion, those worries never happened because we put all the grey matter at work to avoid this. 

### Should we worry about everything? 

Well… a big *YES* for the *long-term results* and a small *yes* for the *short-term results*. 

Our survival instinct is strong enough to worry about anything and everything is above and beyond us. We worry about a stain in our shoes that no one, except us, cares about.  I do not say that we should not clean the stain in our shoe, my point is that we do not need to worry about most of the things that may happen **in the short term** because our survival instinct will worry for you: your goal should be to worry less. 

However, where our survival instinct fails, is in putting the energy required (i.e. worrying enough) about the things that will or can happen in 5, 10 or 50 years.  Not worry about what may happen **in the long term**  may make you miserable one day (and it will). This could be tomorrow or next year, but it will come surely unexpected:  you should think every day in those long *term worries* for being better prepared.

Therefore our survival instinct only worries about the short-term results chasing the [Instant Gratification Monkey](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html) or acquiring what I call: Tangible assets.

### Tangible Assets: short-term results.  

Tangible assets are only relevant in the short (or medium) term and are easy to quantify. Those are things such as acquiring resources (e.g. money), recognition or learning a hard-skill. They do not provide lasting happiness since they focus on our **outer world**.  

Therefore there is no need to worry about what will happen today, tomorrow, next week or at the most, next year: your survival instinct is already working 24/7 on this. It is working so hard, that your full work should be not to ‘work and worry' about those (but you will not succeed). Something that helps in this endeavour is to watch less news and to understand that [losses generates twice many pain as gains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion). 

Money is necessary and may take a long time to acquire the required skills to generate it. However, money is only useful if it can support you in the long term or can create intangible assets.  

### Intangible Assets: long-term results

Intangible assets are more difficult to accumulate and quantify. They are built over time and are far away from our survival instinct radar (until their effects appear unexpectedly). The activities required to make those assets are usually not written in any To Do list, and they may result in a couple getting divorced, or a patient with a few months of life by the lack of nurturing those intangible assets. 

They provide lasting happiness since they focus on our **inner world**. 

I believe that to worry about the following intangible assets will generate positive results in the long term:  

- **worrying about health**: This will help you to do more exercise, eat less and better.  In turn, your health will improve, and as you get older, this will help you to be more active. it will also make your confidence to grow.

- **worrying about having lasting and positive relationships**: Studies have shown that [having good relationships is the number 1 factor to live a long and happy life](https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/love-is-all-you-need-insights-from-the-longest-longitudinal-study-on-men-ever-conducted/). This is also proven to be true for the population of [Okinawa, Japan](https://www.tonyrobbins.com/health-vitality/happiness-will-make-you-live-longer/) 

- **worrying about having a meaningful life**: This will help you to focus on doing good things for others and the society, which will make you happier and understand yourself better. It will also help you to use better use of your **limited** time you have left.

- **worrying about having enough wisdom (or mental toughness) to face death**. This may be the most challenging endeavour to achieve in this lifetime: to die happy (by having a spiritual and a proper understanding of life). Budda gave us an eight-steps guideline ([The Eightfold Path](https://www.buddha101.com/p_path.htm)) on how to achieve this. 

### How we remember to worry about the essential things of life (every day)? 

The best way to reflect and remember the above intangible assets is by worrying and meditating about all of those every day (as soon as we get up). The one which will give you more insights and energy to work hard is the last one: worrying about having enough wisdom to face death.  To achieve this, I meditate daily 5min reflecting on the impermanence of life death. 

However, we should not get ever obsessed about those intangible assets in unhealthy ways. As Michael A. Singer says in the [The Untethered Soul](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B003TU29WA/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) , If the strings of a guitar are too tight, they will break. If they are tightened too loose they will not play. The right amount of tension is needed to make them play beautifully. 

Similarly, too much worry, and you will ruin your relationships and health. Too little worry, and you will be blind to everything that can go wrong. 

## Conclusion

If you are reading this article, chances are the economy where you live in will not allow you to die of hunger or cold (even if you try).  Similarly, if you loss your job and you can only afford a [Pink Seat Panda](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Seat_Marbella_1st_series.jpg) the gossip from your neighbors will not kill you.  The good news is that those worries will not even happen because your mind is too busy making sure that you can pay your rent. 

However, if you will die alone, without spiritual faith and a feeling of not having created a meaningful life (because you were too busy chasing the instant gratification monkey), then it will be a big problem. Perhaps you may want to start worrying about this now.  

Although we do not have control of anything, we have slightly more control over the intangible rather than tangible assets.  Therefore we can start building and growing our intangible assets today!
