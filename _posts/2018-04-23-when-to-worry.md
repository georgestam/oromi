Although I fully agree with above quote, I would like to dig deeper into the question: why those worries never happened? 

> I've had a lot of worries in my life, most of which never happened.

In my opinion those never happened because we put all the grey matter at work in making sure that those does not happen. 

50% of the people divorce. Still many people think that those stats do not apply to them. Perhaps if we will worry that divorce may happen to us then we will put all the measures measures to avoid this.

So, yes, I think that not worry is good. But how much to worry? Mindfulness is the answer. 

As the Unthether Suoul, If a strings of a guitar are tight to hard the strings will break. If they are tightened to loose they will not play. The right amount of tensions is needed to make them play beautifully. 

Similarly, Too much worry, and you will ruin you relationships and health, as well as you will live a meaningless life. Too little worry, and you will blind of everything that can go wrong. 

When evaluating Risks, I like to think on all the risks but then We have to know when stop worrying 

My father usually says, 'ocupata not precoupat'. It is difficult to tranlate this on eglish but ocupat means 'keep working', and a 'pre' is unncesiary.

In a practical way, I like to evaluare risks, plan ahead and then have feith that everythink is going to work as plan, without worrying. 

The simple fact of acknowledge a risk and do something about it is the enough level of worrying to take in my opinon 

## Conclusion

We do not have control of anything, but we always have some degree of input of anything that can happen. Applying a small action (or the 80/20 rule) to any event we worry about, is more than enough in most of the situations.
